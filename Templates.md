# How to use templates with YARLE

You can control the Markdown output generated by YARLE by using templates like the one below, which is similar to YARLE's default template (which is located [here](./src/utils/templates/default-template.ts)):


To provide a template to YARLE just pass it as a parameter in `config.json`, e.g `templateFile: '/../path/to/template.md'`. You can use any file name/extension you want.

A template has two basic elements, a "block" tag which encloses the type of content it will produce, and also the formatting you want around it (e.g. `#` for a header, or `---` for a separator), and the content tag itself such as `{tags}` and `{content}`. Every content tag must have its block surrounding it.

If you suppress any of the blocks, it will be skipped altogether, for example if you want to have Markdown files with just the title and the main content, and you could use a template such as

```
{title-block}# {title}{end-title-block}

{content-block}{content}{end-content-block}
```

The possible blocks are the followings:

| Name | Placeholder | Description |Â 
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Title |Â {title-block}{title}{end-title-block} |Â Adds title|
| Tags |Â {tags-block}{tags}{end-tags-block} | Tags block|
|Â Content |Â {content-block}{content}{end-content-block} |Â The actual content of the note|
| Date of creation |Â {created-at-block}{created-at}{end-created-at-block} |Â The creation date of the note|
| Last update | {updated-at-block}{updated-at}{end-updated-at-block}| Last update of the note|
| Source URLÂ |Â {source-url-block}{source-url}{end-source-url-block}Â |Â The source URL|
| Original Notebook Name |Â {notebook-block}{notebook}{end-notebook-block}|Â Name of the EN notebook in where the note placed|
| Link to the HTML file |Â {link-to-original-block}{link-to-original}{end-link-to-original-block}| If it's set, then a HTML version of the note will be generated in the note's resource folder, and it will be referenced here|
| Location|   {location-block}{location}{end-location-block}Â |Â The GPS coordinates of the location where the note has been taken |

## Example: 

```
{title-block}# {title}{end-title-block}

{tags-block}
---
Tag(s): {tags}

---
{end-tags-block}

{content-block}{content}{end-content-block}

    {created-at-block}    Created at: {created-at}{end-created-at-block}
    {updated-at-block}    Updated at: {updated-at}{end-updated-at-block}
    {source-url-block}    Source: {source-url}{end-source-url-block}
    {notebook-block}      Notebook: {notebook}{end-notebook-block}
    {link-to-original-block}      Link to original content: {link-to-original}{end-link-to-original-block}
    {location-block}    Where: {location}{end-location-block}
```

As a good base, your can edit sampleTemplate.tmpl, and refer to it in the config file's template file parameter. 


Have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ
