# How to use templates with YARLE

You can control the Markdown output generated by YARLE by using templates like the one below, which is similar to YARLE's default template:

```
{title-block}# {title}{end-title-block}

{tags-block}
---
Tag(s): {tags}

---
{end-tags-block}

{content-block}{content}{end-content-block}

{metadata-block}
    {created-at-block}    Created at: {created-at}{end-created-at-block}
    {updated-at-block}    Updated at: {updated-at}{end-updated-at-block}
    {location-block}    Where: {location}{end-location-block}
{end-metadata-block}
```

A template has two basic elements, a "block" tag which encloses the type of content it will produce, and also the formatting you want around it (e.g. `#` for a header, or `---` for a separator), and the content tag itself such as `{tags}` and `{content}`. Every content tag must have its block surrounding it.

If you suppress any of the blocks, it will be skipped altogether, for example if you want to have Markdown files without tags, just romove `{tags-block}` from the template.

Have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ
